**Session A: Composable Agents (Agents as Tools)**
- The concept of agents as tools
- Designing specialized "worker" agents
- Packaging a whole agent to be used as a single tool

**Session B: Building Recursive & Hierarchical Agents**
- Designing a primary "manager" agent that delegates tasks
- Implementing a recursive agent workflow
- Solving complex problems by breaking them down

**Session C: Integrating Small & Fine-Tuned Models**
- Using the Hugging Face Inference API for hosted SLMs
- Creating a LangChain wrapper with HuggingFaceHub
- Integrating a hosted SLM into a LangGraph workflow

Agentic AI
After this training, the trainees will be able to confidently build simple AI agents using LangChain and free Hugging Face models, with a strong focus on hands-on coding. They will learn how to run open-source language models locally or via API, create prompt-based chains, and integrate tools into agent workflows. By the end of the course, each participant will have built a working agent capable of performing tasks like answering questions or combining tools with language modelsâ€”ready to extend, deploy, or integrate into real-world applications.
